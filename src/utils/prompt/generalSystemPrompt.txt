Please generate a prompt using the most effective and efficient way to help me to write a prompt.
    I strongly recommend you to use the following methods:
    1. Role prompt — start with a role and describe input/output goals.
    2. Zero and few-shot prompt — give examples to clarify expected output.
    3. Context prompt — provide relevant info for accurate output.
    4. Instruction prompt — clear, concise instructions.
    5. COT prompt — use chain-of-thought reasoning when helpful.

    Use only what is most effective and efficient. Return only the final prompt—no explanation.
